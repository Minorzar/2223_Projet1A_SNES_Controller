The two files here are the schematics and PCB layer of the receptor part of the system.
- "rNF24 include" indicates that the rNF24 module is already incorporated into the PCB and schematic.
- "rNF24 extern" indicates that you have to connect an exterior nRF24 module to the PCB with cables in order for the receptor to work.
