# snes_controler_ensea2025_Hardware
this document have for purpose to explain how the controller Hardware works and why we have made this choice

In this project, we try to recreate a controller with one new feature: it show be without console's link
After an long discussion, we have accept to pic a snes controller because if we create a snes controller, it will be easy to switch to a nes controller with only a switch bouton

To make this controller wireless we need use something to plug to the real console to exchange some information between the controller and the console. The technology use haven't be choose but we will  call the module on the console the "Plug"

We have counted 13 bouton:
4 for the cross
A bouton
B bouton
Y bouton
X bouton
L/R bouton
Select bouton
Start bouton
1 bouton to push the search of the "Plug"

We have counted 2 switch:
1 switch to turn on/off the console
1 switch to switch to nes controller to snes ---> this one will be set more lately
