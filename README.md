# snes_project_ensea2025
This is the repository of the SNES project carried out at ENSEA by the promotion of 2025.

During the first year, our project will focus only on the controller aspect of the SNES before moving on to the console itself the following year. This repository will most likely only contain files relevant to the controller.
Our repository will be divided into different sections such as "References", "Data sheets", "Hardware" and "Software".
For more details on each section, a readme can be found inside the folders.
