# SNES Project (Controller)

This is the repository of the SNES project carried out at ENSEA by the promotion of 2025.

In the first year, as part of a three-month project, we will attempt to create our own version of the SNES controller. The aim will be to complete the controller ourselves, both in terms of hardware and software, while adding features that were not present on the original controller. However, this is only the first part of our SNES project, as we'll be continuing the project next year, this time focusing on the console itself. As such, this repository will probably only contain files relevant to the controller.

This GitHub contains 3 important sections, each separated by a folder: "Hardware", "Software" and "Datasheets". Apart from the section on datasheets, more detailed information on each of these parts of the project can be found in the readme in the link below or in their respective folders.
