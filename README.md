# snes_project_ensea2025
This is the repository of the snes project made in the ENSEA by the 2025 promotion.


Our project will first focus on the controller (next year it will be on the console itself). This repository will most likely only contains the files for the controller.
Currently, we are working on looking how the controller works and so get the first ideas of what we are going to do.
Next, we will do the Gantt diagram for both the hardware and software.
All the datasheet will also be found in the main branch.
